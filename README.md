# Cisco-Firepower-ThreadDefense-ACP-CSV-Export
This project is about exporting the Access Control Policies from a Cisco Firepower Management Center as a CSV file.

<br>
<br> As the regular documentation of the switched firewall rules in a Cisco Firepower Management Center takes a lot of time, this process, which takes place regularly at various customers, is to be automated. For example, a process in which an inventory list of the rules can be compared with the currently activated rules can take several hours.
<br>
<br> By automating the process, this hour-long effort can be simplified to around 5 minutes.
To do this, a Python script is executed on the customer's jump host, which contacts the FMC and dials in using the administrator login data. A CSV file is generated by a database query, which contains some basic information relevant to us.
However, as Python must be installed for this, which may not be very advisable for security reasons, this process can also be optimized. Using the Python program pyInstaller, a stand-alone Microsoft executable file can be created from a script that requires Python to be executed and installed on the host, which also works without requiring a Python installation on the host.
<br>
<br> Although a single executable file is much easier to handle, it can also make sense to use a "normal" program that refers to subdirectories with binary files. This is because the libraries used by the executable can be viewed by the integrated virus scanner, especially for KRITIS customers. This means that the virus protection system can still report and intervene in the event of a compromised library.
As an additional security measure, the executable file can also be provided with a certificate from the internal CA.
<br>
<br> The script on which the executable is based runs under the BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" license. This means that the script can also be used in commercial areas.

<br> To convert the script into an executable, you need Python 3 on your computer to prepare the program.
The following dependencies must then be installed on the PC (also possible without administrator rights) using the following commands:

```py
pip install fireREST
```
```py
pip install netaddr
```
```py
pip install datetime
```
```py
pip install ipaddress
```
```py
pip install pyinstaller
```
<br>
<br> Then navigate to the folder in which the script.py is stored. A single executable can then be created with the following command:

```py
pyinstaller --onefile .\policyCSV.py
```

<br>
<br> Or alternatively, a program that does not carry all dependencies in one file and instead works with subdirectories:

```py
pyinstaller .\policyCSV.py
```

<br>
<br> This program is now basically ready and can be transferred to the target system. Neither Python nor the dependencies installed above via pip need to be installed on the target system, as these have already been integrated into the executable by the pyInstaller.
